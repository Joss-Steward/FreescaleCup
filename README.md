## About

This repository holds the code for Null Pointer's entry into the [Freescale Cup](https://community.freescale.com/docs/DOC-1284).

Null Pointer is one of the student groups at [Shippensburg University](https://www.ship.edu) in Shippensburg, PA.

This project is intended to run on the [TFC-Kit](http://www.nxp.com/products/microcontrollers-and-processors/power-architecture-processors/mpc5xxx-5xxx-32-bit-mcus/mpc56xx-mcus/the-freescale-cup-intelligent-car-development-system:TFC-KIT) from Freescale.

All of the mounts, bumpers, and spikes on our car were designed and then printed by us, and the models may be found [here](https://github.com/redja150/Freescale-3D).

## Contributing

If you are on the Null Pointer team and would like to contribute to the code, you will need to install [Code Warrior](http://www.nxp.com/products/software-and-tools/software-development-tools/codewarrior-development-tools/downloads/special-edition-software:CW_SPECIALEDITIONS), and I would recommend making sure you have a solid grasp on the code before making any large changes.

Help adding comments and cleaning up the code base will _always_ be appreciated.
